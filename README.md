### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Alvin Manoj Alex here!

I'm a passionate Web developer, problem solver, AI enthusiast and an avid book reader, hailing from Kochi, Kerala, India. I love to try out new things in Tech Stacks, and enjoy collaborating with others on projects. Picking up a new book, checking out other project ideas, or simply roaming around are my favorite ways to binge my time.
Currently pursuing B.Tech in CS at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai.
